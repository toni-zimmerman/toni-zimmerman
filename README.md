A budding data analyst, eager to dive deep into the world of data and uncover hidden insights.

Fresh out of TripleTen's BIA program, I'm excited to apply my skills in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and data visualization using Tableau. I'm particularly passionate about deriving actionable insights that drive real business impact.

My current focus is on expanding my knowledge in market research, category management, and customer engagement. I'm driven by a desire to understand the "why" behind the data and translate complex findings into clear, compelling stories.

Once I start something, I'm committed to seeing it through. I'm a quick learner, always eager to tackle new challenges and grow my skillset.

Let's connect and explore the exciting possibilities that data can unlock!
